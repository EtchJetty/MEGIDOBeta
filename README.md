# MEGIDO Beta
A characterswap mod for HADES. In extremely early alpha. 

Requires the [Mod Importer]("https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26") and [ModUtil]("https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27") to work. 

Just download this repo as a zip file (go to Code -> Download as Zip) and then extract it into your Mods folder. (If you don't have one, make it in the Content folder of your Hades game files, which should also have folders like "Game" and "Scripts" etc.) Place the unzipped folder (and the unzipped ModUtil if you dont have it already) into your Mods folder, place the .exe or .py modimporter applet in your Content folder (NOT YOUR MODS FOLDER) and you should be able to boot the game! 

(If you're getting errors, or I messed up significantly somehow, check out the [Hades Modding Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/KuMbyrN) for info/troubleshooting. I'll put up documentation on how this early version works at a later date.
