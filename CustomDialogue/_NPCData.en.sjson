        Zagreus: I'm sorry, Dusa, I... put a lot on you, and... maybe I shouldn't have, since I'm the Prince and everything, as you point out, and... sometimes, I forget myself. I'd never pressure you, it's just... I thought you had these feelings for me, too.
        Dusa: I {#DialogueItalicFormat}do {#PreviousFormat}have feelings for you, silly! That's what I've been trying to tell you, it's just... it's just...
        Zagreus: It's just what...? Whatever it is, it's OK. You can be yourself with me, Dusa, I promise.
        Dusa: I'm glad you put it that way. I... I'm not looking for an intimate relationship. You're the kindest soul in this whole House. And I have learned so much from you! But, when I really think about my feelings... I'm just, not attracted to you, in that way. I'm sorry. You're a really nice guy!
        Zagreus: Oh, {#DialogueItalicFormat}hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, look, there's nothing to apologize for, not at all. In fact... all this is a relief. I've learned a lot from you, too, and I cherish our friendship for what it is. Do you... do you think that we could still be friends? Or, is it better that you didn't see me anymore...?
        Dusa: Don't say {#DialogueItalicFormat}that{#PreviousFormat}! Though, I was going to ask you the same thing. I'd really like it if you'd be my friend! Though, my career comes first, so... I don't want you doing any special favors, promise me? I need to see how far I can get on my own.
        Zagreus: I respect that so much, and yes, I promise, Dusa. So, well, then... friends? For all eternity?

        Megaera: Before that, he did worse. He was an awful man. I think that is the real reason that your father punished him.

        Persephone: I wanted to see you, too. Come, speak quickly with me, that our time together here may be as full as possible, all right?
        Zagreus: I just... I need to know what happened, between you and Father. Why are you here, and not with us?
        Persephone: I couldn't live with myself anymore, down there. After I left Olympus, a long story in itself, I came to be with your father, in the Underworld. It was a shock, to say the least. The others in your father's house were welcoming enough, but... I never felt that I belonged.
        Zagreus: I know the feeling, I think. But you stayed. Long enough to have me. Those whom I've spoken to about you, it's as you said, they have fond memories of you. And then, you even had a child. Did Father... did he mistreat you?
        Persephone: No, no. Your father could be very difficult. Though, he was gentle, with me. Soon enough, we got on fine, better than fine, at times, but... when I was with child... why, I struggled terribly. Because... a child born of surface-dwellers could not live, down there.
        Zagreus: Could not live down there, according to whom, exactly? The Fates?
        Persephone: According to them, yes. According to your father, and to Nyx. Even having heard... I took my chances, anyway. But when you emerged stillborn... it was too much. I fled. I fled, and came to reside here. Above the notice of the Underworld. Beneath the notice of Olympus.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Urgh{#PreviousFormat}... but... why would Father lie to you? If he never wanted you... or never wanted me... surely he had the means.
        Persephone: I don't know. I'm wondering the same. But, oh, look at you, Zagreus! We're running out of time. It's happening again! Stay with me, please?
        Zagreus: ...I'm trying... but I can't... stay that much longer... I don't think.
        Persephone: Oh, my dear son! Then please... ask Hades what you asked of me! Why he would lie? Tell him I must know, the same as you. And you farewell. Until we meet again!

        Zagreus: Wait, what? Because of what would happen if the Olympians found out? So, after everything, you're taking {#DialogueItalicFormat}Father{#PreviousFormat}'s side in all of this?!
        Persephone: I am. Your father is no fool when it comes to matters such as this. Besides... all that has happened... it's my fault. I was selfish! And now both sides of our family threaten to be torn apart.
        Zagreus: Your fault? So let's say you never left Olympus! Then it'd be just like you thought, until quite recently, I think. That I'd never existed! Besides, they haven't found out any of this. What makes you so sure they will, all the sudden?
        Persephone: Nyx may be veiling you from them as she veiled me when I fled here myself. But even her own powers aren't infallible. Each time you visit me, you are incurring risk. One small slip, and they shall find me. Discover your deception. Go home, Zagreus. Please.
        Zagreus: Go home {#DialogueItalicFormat}with {#PreviousFormat}me, Mother! You came here under false pretenses. I haven't fought all this way, over and over again, only to turn back now. I need you in my life! How can you just... turn me away like this?
        Persephone: Oh, Zagreus... I cannot return. After all that happened between Hades and me, and everyone, I just cannot fathom the idea. Besides... the risks we're taking would be even greater if Olympus were to find me there, with him. And you.
        Zagreus: Then... {#DialogueItalicFormat}ungh{#PreviousFormat}... you're just... going to stay here? Alone, in the middle of nowhere, in this little garden... forever? After we part ways, just like that?
        Persephone: My son... I know you've made hard choices and sacrifices to be here with me. And I'm forever grateful to have finally met you. But this is my home, now, yes. While your home is below. Please, if not for your sake, then for mine... do not return. I love you, Zagreus. Good-bye.

        Zagreus: Your mortal father, right...? So he called you Persephone. What was he like?
        Persephone: He was kind to me. And funny! Little bringer of destruction, I was to him. I liked that. He was right, I was a terror. But then he passed. I was very little still. My mother never spoke of him again.
        Zagreus: Demeter mentioned him a bit to me. She seems... I don't know, but I don't sense that she regrets the relationship or anything. Just sad about the outcome I think.
        Persephone: I suppose I can see that. I thought I might end up like Father... growing old, wasting away. Then the time flew by, and I realized I was closer to Mother's side. Mortals certainly don't have it easy. But their limited days, it means... they live their lives to the fullest, I think.

        Persephone: Oh, you know! That we met, fell in love, eloped. Had a child. A child who, once grown, sought desperately to reconnect with his extended family. To the chagrin of his grim lord father...
        Zagreus: That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.
        Persephone: ...Fortunately, our loving and dutiful son at last persuaded his mother and father to reveal their secretive relationship, and make an effort to rejoin their great family.
        Zagreus: Your mother won't be happy that you left.
        Persephone: I'll deal with her. Perhaps I'll have to visit her and the rest of them from time to time, if that's what it shall take. But I'll be back. I've no choice! Did you know that if you eat the seeds of an Underworld pomegranate, then you cannot leave for one month out of the year, per seed?
        Zagreus: What? No, I never knew that.
        Persephone: Neither do they.

        Zagreus: Yes, Mother. So what do you intend to do, and how do I fit in?
        Persephone: We're going to invite all of them to a little family gathering! Here. And you shall personally deliver them their invitations, Zagreus.

        Zagreus: That's... that's all true. As individual statements, at least.

        Persephone: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whew{#PreviousFormat}! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part.
        Zagreus: We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
        Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
        Zagreus: You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
        Persephone: The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.
        Zagreus: You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?
        Persephone: Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.
        Zagreus: And Uncle Zeus is glad things didn't turn out worse for {#DialogueItalicFormat}him{#PreviousFormat}. I get the sense he acts a bit impulsively at times, and deals with the consequences later.
        Persephone: What can I tell you, Zagreus? We're family. You said it yourself to me before: We're stuck with one another. That any of us like each other in the slightest... it's a wonder and a blessing, I think.
        Zagreus: Yeah. I know what you mean. Thanks, Mother. Think I'll be heading out again soon. See you when I get back?

        Zagreus: It's done, Mother! Father. The invitations. Personally sent to everyone with whom I've been in contact. So, what do we do now?
        Persephone: Excellent, Zagreus! Congratulate him, Hades! On a job well done.
        Hades: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Grr. {#PreviousFormat}Persephone, how can you be so certain your request was executed to your satisfaction?
        Persephone: It's known as trust, Hades. Or faith? They're similar. Try one, sometime! It'll be good for you. As for what we do next... why, we've a great, big feast we must prepare!
        Hades: This House is not a suitable location for such guests! Dionysus, alone, shall bring ruin to this place! Or... {#DialogueItalicFormat}urgh{#PreviousFormat}... the faith thing that you said.
        Persephone: Yes, good! Now then... we have a lot of work to go around, so why don't we call everyone on staff, and let them in on this, and dole out suitable responsibilities, all right?
        Hades: All right....
        Zagreus: All right.
        Persephone: All right!
        Persephone: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Whew{#PreviousFormat}! I'd say that went about as well as could have been expected! And the cleanup wasn't all that bad. For the most part.
        Zagreus: We're fortunate Uncle Zeus seemed to catch on right away, and went along with it. But, this whole elaborate tale you spun... I remember how hurt I felt when I found out Father lied to me about you. Now we're lying to Olympus. What if they find out? Even if they don't... I don't like it.
        Persephone: Zagreus... I may not be an expert... but here's what I've come to understand about how families work. At least our own. The thing is... how we speak to one another is even more important than the words we use. I think, deep down, everyone in our family knows this.
        Zagreus: You're saying they all knew you weren't being perfectly honest, and went along with it anyway? I guess the pomegranate thing in particular was a bit of a stretch.
        Persephone: The common ground in our family is that we want peace. Besides Ares, though even he would rather the conflict occur elsewhere. That elaborate tale... it's less a deception, and more a concession. A way of saying let's move on from the past, and start anew. No hard feelings.
        Zagreus: You don't have hard feelings? What about Father? What about Demeter?
        Persephone: Well, let's see. My hard feelings are nothing next to the joy of having my son in my life. Your father never imagined his relationship with me could be out in the open. And my mother... she's just glad I'm alive.

        Persephone: Indeed... something like that. You're quite perceptive, have I ever told you, Zagreus? But yes, my mother, she was quite conflicted. Didn't know whether to smite me or to hold me, maybe both. And, yes. She asked that I come home... to my responsibilities.
        Zagreus: So... you're leaving...? No, Mother, you can't be leaving, you just got here!
        Persephone: Oh, it's not as bad as that, it's just... if we are to keep the peace down here, then, I must spend some time up there. Every so often! But, I shall always return, in no time at all. I promised Hades, and I promise you.
        Zagreus: Well then... when are you going to go?
        Persephone: Soon, Zagreus. Perhaps by the time you're back.
        Zagreus: I don't suppose... I can come with you, can I?
        Persephone: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Tsk{#PreviousFormat}, you know the surface isn't good for you! Besides, you're needed here. But, if you really want to see it for yourself, someday, who knows? Perhaps eventually we'll figure out a way.
        Zagreus: I'm going to miss you, Mother.

        Persephone: You know, it's funny... I think she was so overwhelmed to see me again that maybe something finally changed in her. I always thought she was utterly unyielding. She asked me if I truly came here by choice, and I put her at ease.
