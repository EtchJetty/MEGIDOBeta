        Chaos: You make an even greater offering to me, knowing it shall produce no material result. You are aware that I am not persuadable? Yours is a squandering of resources and time. Although, of course, we do have each of these in great supply. Now then, respond.
        Zagreus: ...I just think the act of giving isn't quite the same as an exchange. I know I won't be getting any sort of other talisman or something in return. But, through these offerings, I can express my thanks. That's worth it by itself.
        Chaos: ...I see. So then, the action is akin to theft. For you are getting something in return that I did not intend to give. I still have much to learn from my creations, Son of Hades. So let us say that we have made an even trade. My learning for your worth.

        Zagreus: Don't even mention it, please, Master Chaos. All of this is new for me, as well. I try never to overanalyze... my father does enough of that for all of us. I just know, when I encounter the primordial creator, I am going to give thanks. For everything.
        Chaos: ...I see. Then, your response is quite acceptable. And, since the act of giving is not an exchange, let us say that you already had my gratitude.
